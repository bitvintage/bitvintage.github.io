    <p class="post-hero">We take all our own photos, so the item you see, is the exact item you get!  No stock photos, no reused photos, only <strong style="color:#c70b0b;">high quality</strong> images for every <strong style="color:#c70b0b;">unique</strong> item.  We photograph every significant aspect of each item, giving you the same opportunity to evaluate and decide for yourself an item's condition, just like you could if you were browsing in a brick and mortar store!</p>
